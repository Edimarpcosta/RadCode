Sometimes you need to change a some property for each components. Of course, if
these components have a common ancestor, then you can write:
}

var i: Integer;
begin
  for i := 0 to ComponentCount-1 do
    if Components[i] is TyourAncestor then
       TyourAncestor(Components[i]).yourProperty := yourValue;
end;

// For example,

var i: Integer;
begin
  for i := 0 to ComponentCount-1 do
    if Components[i] is TSpeedButton then
       TSpeedButton(Components[i]).Flat := True;
end;

{
But frequently you need change a property but the components haven't a common
ancestor. In an example above you can have a TSpeedButton's components and
TDBNavigator component on same panel. These components have taken place from
different ancesors and you must change a property as different. You can
make following:
}

var i: Integer;
    PropInfo: PPropInfo;
begin
  for i := 0 to ComponentCount-1 do
  begin
    PropInfo := GetPropInfo(Components[i].ClassInfo, yourPropertyName);
    {if such property exists}
    if Assigned(PropInfo) then
      SetOrdProp(Components[i], PropInfo, LongInt(yourPropertyValue));
  end;
end;
